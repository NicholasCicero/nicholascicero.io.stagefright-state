            <p class="noto-sans-mono"> Stagefright is an up and coming American progressive rock band who produce rock music with a technical focus. Our mission is to make music that our listeners can enjoy for the sound, and appreciate for the technical aspects. We pride ourselves on pushing the boundaries of the rock genre and creating music that feels fresh. We are constantly experimenting with unconventional techniques and honing our craft. Currently, we have one released album: Circles Around my Mind. We are available to book for events.
