            <h2>What is Stage Fright</h2>
            <p class="about-description">We are an up and coming American progressive rock band who produce rock music with a technical focus.
                Our sound is a combination of heavy metal bands such as Metallica and Dio and math rock bands such as American Football.
                Our mission is to make music that our listeners can enjoy for the sound, and appreciate for the technical aspects.
                We pride ourselves on pushing the boundaries of the rock genre and creating music that feels fresh.
                We are constantly experimenting with unconventional techniques and honing our craft.
                Currently, we have one released album: Star Scream. We are available to <a class="about-link" href="booking.html">book for events</a>.

            <h2>How we Started</h2>
            <p class="about-description">Stagefright is something we all dreamed of starting before meeting each other.
                We all met in college and were very passionate about music.
                After getting to know one another we decided to Start a band and chase our dreams.
                We started out playing any venue we could. Anywhere in Northeast Ohio that would let us play, we would.
                After we released our first album, we began to pick up bigger gigs and become well known.</p>
